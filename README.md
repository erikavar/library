###### Update 9/4/2022: Created this separate branch to refactor constructors into classes for practice

This is a virtual bookshelf. It can be used to keep a record of the user's books. Books can be added or removed by the user.
Built using Javascript and HTML/CSS.

###### What I Learned
* Generated objects using an object constructor
* Created a function on the prototype instance of an object
* Made a "popup" form that can appear and disappear by using `style.display`
* Used the `bind()` method to make `this` available to another function
* Used `preventDefault()` to prevent form submission
* Google Fonts
